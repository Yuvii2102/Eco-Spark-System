 # 🌍 Eco-Monitoring Hub

* Eco Monitoring Hub is a simple web dashboard that tracks live carbon intensity from an energy grid and provides smart recommendations based on environmental impact.

* This project promotes eco-friendly computing by helping users decide when to run energy-heavy tasks.

## 🚀 Features

- Live carbon intensity tracking
- Smart eco recommendations
- Clean dashboard UI
- Visual carbon status indicator
- Real-time API integration
- Responsive design

---

## 🧠 How It Works

The dashboard connects to a public carbon intensity API and retrieves real-time energy data. Based on the carbon level:

✅ Low carbon → safe for heavy computing  
⚠ Moderate carbon → balanced usage  
🛑 High carbon → delay energy-intensive tasks  

This encourages environmentally responsible usage.
